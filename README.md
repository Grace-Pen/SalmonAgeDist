# Analyzing Salmon Age Distribution 
  R code used to analyze the changes in the age distribution of hatchery salmon in Alaska.
  The files labeled CHUM 3-6, CHUM 34_56, CHUM 345_6, are the reorganization of returning fish by year for regression on CHUM. The files Year 2 3 Combined, Year 23 67 Combined, Year 2345 67 Combined and Year 23 45 67 Combined are used for the regression on Chinook salmon. CHUM_EggsReleased is used in the linear model in R as the y variable for Chum regression. Eggs_Released_Each_Year is used in the linear model in R as the y variable for Chinook regression. 
  There is a powerpoint presentation available to view that outlines the framework of our research, as well as includes additional graphs that demonstrate the key conclusions of our analysis.
